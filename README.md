ASSIGNMENT 2 AR and Gamification [asg 2.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Real-Time-Graphics/files/7598777/asg.2.pdf)

In this assignment, you will need to read relevant scientific papers, apply critical thinking, analysis, and current examples related to Augmented Reality (AR) and Gamification.

i.	Write a review article on “How Gamification and Augmented Reality enriched learning experience enhance engagement in Early childhood Mathematics education”. [9-12 pages]

ii.	A review article reports a critical evaluation of materials about current research that has already been published by organizing, integrating, and evaluating previously published materials. It summarizes the status of knowledge and outlines future directions of research within the journal scope. A review article should aim to provide systemic overviews, evaluations, and interpretations of research in each field. (source: pertanika.upm.edu.my)

- 3D polygon/model or character animation with control input OR
- 2D/3D game with control input
- AR or non-AR
- Mobile or desktop

For “Maths education for Kids”
- Target audience: 5 to 8 year old
- Choose any topic
- Think about
o Game story, mechanics/rules, rewards, level of difficulty (stage 1 -easy, stage 2- medium, stage 3- hard)
You are free to use any existing 2D or 3D character and references available online OR from the assets store.
